# amazingbrick (2018)
Note that this game concept is originally made by Ketchapp Games. I just tried to code this game in pure javascript.

If you want to edit the code and make a new apk, you need to download the AmazingBrick.rar file to access the whole project folder.
If you want to read the code to have an idea, you need to access /www/js/index.js file. The whole game algorithm is in there.

Also, note that this game is made in 2018, and discontinued since 2019.
Therefore, you may need to upgrade your Cordoba, Gradle and some of the plugins may not even be supported anymore.
